## TWO-DIMENSIONAL OCULOMOTOR CONTROL USING SPIKING NEURON MODEL

### Abstract
The neural mechanism of oculomotor control has been studied extensively for decades. While
many oculomotor control models focus on the neural integrator, this project also emphasizes the
process of producing the velocity signal from the position signal given by visual cortex. An error
correction subsystem is implemented to achieve both higher accuracy of saccades and fixation in
the presence of centripetal gaze-dependent drift. We then show the whole system achieved good
performance by coordinating the two subsystems.

### Running simulation
The simulation only requires one Jupyter Notebook source file: `Final_Project.ipynb`. So it suffices to run
```
jupyter Final_Project.ipynb
```

### About this project
Final project of an undergraduate course at the University of Waterloo, SYDE 556: simulating neurobiological system. The project is my own work.
